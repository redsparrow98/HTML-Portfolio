            <h2>What have i done so far</h2>
            <p>Oh, let me tell you, it's been a rollercoaster of learning curves and "Eureka!" moments!<br />
                From untangling code knots that could rival a plate of spaghetti to mastering the art of
                googling error messages like a pro, I've been on quite the journey.</p>

            <p>I've built websites that could pass for digital forts, apps so simple even my grandma could
                navigate them, and algorithms that, well, let's just say they're a work in progress.
                And let's not forget the countless cups of coffee keeping me awake during those late-night coding sessions.</p>
            
            <p>But hey, Rome wasn't built in a day, right?<br />
